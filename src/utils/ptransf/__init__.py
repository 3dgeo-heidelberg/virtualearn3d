The point transformation package contains the logic to advanced point
transformation operations. They are not simply feature transformation.
For example, a grid-based receptive field where the cells of the grid
represent the discrete units of receptive field that can be used to
reduce the point cloud to a representation but also to propagate values
from the representation to the point cloud is an example of a point
transformation model.
