class ReceptiveFieldHierarchicalFPS(ReceptiveField):
    r"""
    :author: Alberto M. Esmoris Pena

    Class representing a hierarchical receptive field based on furthest point
    subsampling.

    A hierarchical receptive field is a special type of receptive field because
    it is composed of many receptive fields organized in a hierarchical manner.

    See :class:`.ReceptiveField`, :class:`.ReceptiveFieldFPS`, and
    :class:`.HierarchicalFPSPreProcessor`.

    :ivar num_points_per_depth: The number of points
        :math:`R_d \in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}` at depth :math:`d`.
        In other words, for a given number of input points :math:`m`,
        and a hierarchy of max depth :math:`d^*` the reduced number of
        points will be :math:`m \geq R_1 \geq \ldots \geq R_{d^*}`.
        The value of :math:`R_d` will be the same, even for
        different numbers of input points.
    :vartype num_points_per_depth: list or tuple or :class:`np.ndarray` of int
    :ivar fast_flag_per_depth: A flag for each depth level to enable the
        fast-computation mode. When True, a random uniform subsampling will be
        computed before the furthest point sampling so the latest is faster
        because it is not considering the entire input point cloud.
    :vartype fast_flag_per_depth: list or tuple or :class:`np.ndarray` of bool
    :ivar num_downsampling_neighbors: How many neighbors consider at each depth
        to compute the subsampling. For each depth, the number specifies how
        many points from the source space will be involved in the
        computation of each point in the downsampled space. The
        neighborhoods are made of the k-nearest neighbors. Note that
        the first value in this list corresponds to the
        ``num_encoding_neighbors`` attribute of the
        :class:`.ReceptiveFieldFPS` receptive field.
    :vartype num_downsampling_neighbors: list or tuple or :class:`np.ndarray`
        of int
    :ivar num_pwise_neighbors: How many nearest neighbors consider at each
        depth-level. In other words, for each point in the structure space at
        any given depth, the number of nearest neighbors in the same
        structure space that must be considered.
    :vartype num_pwise_neighbors: list or tuple or :class:`np.ndarray` of int
    :ivar num_upsampling_neighbors: How many neighbors consider at each depth
        to compute the upsampling. For each depth, the number specifies how
        many points from the source space will be involved in the
        computation of each point in the upsampled space. The
        neighborhoods are made of the k-nearest neighbors. Note that
        the first value in this list corresponds to the reverse
        indexing matrix (``M`` attribute) of the
        :class:`.ReceptiveFieldFPS` receptive field.
    :vartype num_upsampling_neighbors: list or tuple or :class:`np.ndarray`
        of int
    :ivar max_depth: The max depth of the hierarchy, i.e., how many receptive
        fields.
    :vartype max_depth: int
    :ivar NDs: The :math:`\pmb{N}^D_d` matrices of
        indices for downsampling with depth :math:`d=1,\ldots,d^*`.
        More concretely, :math:`n^D_{dij}`
        is the index of the j-th neighbor in the structure space before
        the downsampling of the i-th point in the downsampled structure space
        (at depth :math:`d`).
        It can be seen as an indexing tensor whose slices can be seen as
        indexing matrices.
    :vartype NDs: list of :class:`np.ndarray` of int
    :ivar Ns: The :math:`\pmb{N}_d` matrices of indices for neighborhoods
        with depth :math:`d=1,\ldots,d^*`.
        More concretely, :math:`n_{dij}` is the index of the j-th neighbor of
        the i-th point in the structure space at depth :math:`d`.
        It can be seen as an indexing tensor whose slices can be seen as
        indexing matrices.
    :vartype Ns: list of :class:`np.ndarray` of int
    :ivar NUs: The :math:`\pmb{N}^U_d` matrices of indices for upsampling with
        depth :math:`d=1,\ldots,d^*`.
        More concretely, :math:`n^U_{dij}` is the index of the j-th neighbor
        in the structure space before the upsampling of the i-th point in the
        upsampled structure space (at depth :math:`d`).
    :vartype NUs: list of :class:`np.ndarray` of int
    :ivar x: The center point of the receptive field. It is assigned when
        calling :meth:`receptive_field_fps.ReceptiveFieldFPS.fit`.
    :vartype x: :class:`np.ndarray`
    :ivar Ys: The hierarchical subsamples representing the original input point
        cloud and, i.e., a matrices of coordinates in a :math:`n_x`-dimensional
        space such that :math:`\pmb{Y}_d \in \mathbb{R}^{R_d \times n_x}`.
    :vartype Ys: :class:`np.ndarray`
