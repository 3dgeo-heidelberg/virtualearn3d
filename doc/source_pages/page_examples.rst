Examples
***********

We would appreciate feedback from our users, especially the one that comes as a
simple, reproducible example of how they applied the framework to solve a
particular problem. We strongly believe that a community-driven set of examples
will foster the accessibility of the VL3D framework because new users could
find hands-on examples of how to approach similar problems to theirs.

We are happy to receive any example for the documentation to
`alberto.esmoris@uni-heidelberg.de <alberto.esmoris@uni-heidelberg.de>`_,
provided it satisfies the following requirements:


    #. JSON
        A JSON specification to reproduce the results must be provided.

    #. Data
        A dataset representing the problem must be provided.
        It must be adequate to reproduce the results when running the framework
        with the provided JSON.

    #. Quantification
        Of the many potential quantitative reports that can be generated with
        the framework, at least one must be given. Preferably, one that
        quantifies the results of the model.

    #. Visualization
        Of the many potential graphical representations (either plots or
        point clouds), one must be provided. Preferably, one that is of
        interest to understand the results or the model.

    #. Text
        A small text from one to three paragraphs explaining the pipeline,
        discussing the results, or contextualizing the final application
        is needed. The text should focus on what YOU consider more relevant
        from your research or application perspective. We expect that readers
        interested in similar topics could benefit from your perspective.
