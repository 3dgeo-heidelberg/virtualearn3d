Introduction
**************

The VirtuaLearn3D (VL3D) framework is a software for point-wise classification and regression on 3D point clouds. It handles the training and prediction operations of the many implemented models. On top of that, it provides useful tools for transforming the point clouds and for automatic feature extraction. Moreover, it also supports evaluations on the data, the models, and the predictions. These evaluations yield further insights and analysis through automatically generated plots, CSV files, text reports, and point clouds.
